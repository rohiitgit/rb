# Changelog

## [2026-09-29 08:55]
- Engineer review of M1a:
  - service `role` (service, library, unassigned) replaces the deployable and synthetic flags;
  - stored `path` and owner `type` removed (both derivable);
  - `project_for` uses binary search, with sorting enforced by `Boundaries::new`;
  - explicit `rb.toml` name override.
- Evaluator fixes, each with a regression test:
  - `docs/*/` and `*/` now match;
  - a literal `*` in a filename no longer breaks wildcard matching;
  - a directory named `(root)` can no longer capture unassigned files (unassigned files now live on `.`);
  - CRLF and BOM handled in CODEOWNERS;
  - BOM handled in manifests;
  - non-UTF-8 paths are skipped instead of aborting the run;
  - `/* c */ package main` is detected;
  - all text ordering is bytewise (`COLLATE "C"`), not locale-dependent;
  - owners are lowercased;
  - `rb find --limit` is range-checked;
  - `pom.xml` with a DOCTYPE parses.

## [2026-09-29 08:10]
- M1a structure: CODEOWNERS owners with evidence, service boundary detection with `rb.toml`, and the `rb find` and `rb service` commands. Edges now carry evidence, and diagnostics keep their path (migration 0002).
- Fixed pg_trgm being installed into AGE's `ag_catalog` schema (migration 0003). Migrations now pin `search_path = public`.

## [2026-09-29 07:25]
- Initial commit a8f5ac2: the design doc and M0 foundations. This covers the Rust workspace, Postgres 18 + AGE 1.8.0 in compose, snapshot publishing in one transaction, and the `rb migrate`, `index`, `status`, `dump` and `cypher` commands.
