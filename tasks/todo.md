## Review
- Doc written: `docs/repository-brain-design.md` (~900 lines, 14 sections + 3 appendices).
- External facts verified by a research pass; sources are in Appendix C. Items still unverified are listed there.
- The §8.3 DDL was executed on local PG 14 inside a rolled-back transaction. The set-semantic `WITH RECURSIVE … UNION` reachability query terminates on a cycle.
- AGE-specific SQL (the `cypher()` prepared statement, the loaders) has **not** been executed, because there is no AGE instance locally. That is an M0 check.
- Self-review:
  - every edge kind in §8.5 has a producer;
  - Q1–Q4 map to §9.2, §9.3, §9.4 and §10.3;
  - the corrections to the blueprint are in §2.
- No tsc/eslint: there is no code in this deliverable.

# M0 Foundations — implementation (started 2026-09-29)

Exit criteria (design §13): determinism test green on 2 fixtures; `rb cypher` returns files per service.
Scope note: Owner projection needs CODEOWNERS, which is M1. M0 projects File + Service (single `(root)` service) + IN_SERVICE.

- [x] Batch 1 — infra: Cargo workspace, rust-toolchain, compose.yaml (AGE PG18 pinned by digest, port 55432), migration 0001, .gitignore. Verify: DB healthy, migration applies, AGE loader signatures probed.
- [x] Batch 2 — rb-model (kinds, snapshot graph, deterministic ids, canonical dump) + rb-git (gix manifest). Verify: unit tests, clippy -D warnings, fmt.
- [x] Batch 3 — rb-store (migrate, snapshot lifecycle, COPY load, AGE CSV projection, live flip, retention, dump) + rb-cli (`migrate`, `index`, `status`, `dump`, `cypher`). Verify: build + clippy.
- [x] Batch 4 — 2 fixtures + integration tests (determinism, AGE parity, cypher files-per-service), README, doc sync. Verify: full test run against the compose DB.

## M0 review (2026-09-29)

- **Exit criteria met.**
  - Determinism: the same commit indexed into two repos, and a forced rebuild, dump byte-identically on both fixtures. The stored dump also equals the in-memory pipeline's dump.
  - `rb cypher` returns files per service.
  - AGE parity: every relational `IN_SERVICE` edge appears in the projection.
  - `rb cypher` is read-only: a `CREATE` is rejected.
- **Checks:** 19 tests pass, 2 of them end to end against the compose database. `cargo clippy -D warnings` and `cargo fmt --check` are clean.
- **Real-repo smoke test:** A private repo indexed 403 files in 0.26 s, matching `git ls-tree`. Retention keeps the live snapshot plus 2 retired ones and drops their AGE graphs. A failed load rolls back fully (no graph), is marked `failed`, and is cleaned up by the next successful publish.
- **Deviations from the design, now synced into the doc:**
  - AGE loader paths must sit under `/tmp/age/`.
  - `rb.snapshot` is no longer unique on (repo, commit, tools); there is a partial unique index for one live snapshot per repo instead.
  - The Owner projection moved to M1.
- **Environment:**
  - Rust is installed via `brew install rustup`, toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. `~/.zshrc` is untouched, so PATH needs `/opt/homebrew/opt/rustup/bin`.
  - The database runs on port 55432, because 5432 and 5433 are already taken.
- **Not done:** the licence audit (`cargo deny`) listed in design §14. Nothing has been committed (newide is not its own git repo yet).

## Next: M1 Structure (awaiting confirmation)
- CODEOWNERS matcher (in-house on `globset`, last match wins, no `!`/`[]`) → Owner nodes + OWNED_BY
- Service boundary detection (package.json workspaces, Maven/Gradle modules, go.mod, Cargo, pyproject) + `rb.toml` overrides
- Tree-sitter defs/refs/scopes for TS, Java, Python, Go; facts cache keyed by blob SHA
- `rb find`, `rb service` (structure sections)

---

# M1a Structure — CODEOWNERS, boundaries, evidence, `rb find` / `rb service` (started 2026-09-29)

Design decisions made while planning (sync into the doc at the end):
- Every detected project becomes a `Service` node with `deployable: bool`. Libraries are services too; this matches the Service Card example ("shared-lib").
- Service key = the project directory (`.` for the repo root). The synthetic `(root)` service holds files outside every project. Names can collide, so `rb service <name>` returns candidates rather than picking one.
- CODEOWNERS uses an in-house segment matcher (GitHub semantics: `docs/*` is not recursive, and there is no `!`/`[]`). The same matcher handles `rb.toml` exclude globs, so there is one glob engine and no `globset`.
- Edges carry evidence (file path + span), stored in `rb.edge_evidence` and included in the dump (dump format v2).
- Assembly moves from rb-model into a new `rb-indexer` crate (git → structure → graph + diagnostics).

- [x] A — model: `NewEdge`, `Evidence`, `Diagnostic` in rb-model; dump v2; store persists and loads evidence. Verify: all existing tests.
- [x] B — rb-git `Repo` API (manifest + blob reads); `codeowners` module with GitHub-documented table tests.
- [x] C — `boundaries` module: package.json, pom.xml, gradle, go.mod (+ `package main` dirs), Cargo.toml, pyproject, Dockerfile, `rb.toml` overrides/excludes. Unit tests.
- [x] D — `rb-indexer` assembly (Service/Owner nodes, IN_SERVICE, OWNED_BY, diagnostics); store queries; `rb find`, `rb service`.
- [x] E — `polyglot-monorepo` fixture; golden tests for the service list and cards; doc sync. Verify: fmt, clippy, full test run on the DB.

## M1a review (2026-09-29)

- **Checks:** 43 tests pass, 5 of them end to end on the compose DB. Clippy with `-D warnings` and `fmt --check` are clean. No test repos are left in the DB.
- **Goldens:** 7 files for `polyglot-monorepo`, each reviewed by hand against the rules: services, cards, search, and the full dump with evidence and diagnostics. The test was shown to fail when a golden file is tampered with.
- **Real repos:**
  - A private TypeScript repo resolves to one service.
  - A private Java repo resolves to 4 projects, matching its manifests.
- **Bugs found and fixed:**
  - `pg_trgm` was installed into `ag_catalog`, because migrations inherited the AGE search_path. Migration 0003 moves it, and the runner now pins `search_path = public`.
  - A Go `package main // comment` line was not detected.
  - Card output said "1 files".
- **Design decisions,** synced into the doc (§4.2, §4.3, §8.2, §12.3, §13):
  - every project is a Service with `deployable`;
  - the Service key is the project directory;
  - the glob matcher is in-house and shared with `rb.toml`;
  - CODEOWNERS is tested with GitHub-example table tests instead of the planned property tests.
- **Not committed yet:** waiting for confirmation.

## Next: M1b Syntax (awaiting confirmation)
- Tree-sitter grammars (TS/TSX, Java, Python, Go) + `tags.scm` definitions/references + enclosing-scope index
- Symbol nodes (heuristic keys until SCIP lands in M3), `DEFINED_IN` / `CONTAINS` edges with evidence
- Facts cache keyed by (blob SHA, extractor version); `gix` change sets; rayon parallel extraction

---

# M1b Syntax (contract: tasks/contract-m1b.md)

Findings from the research step (2026-09-29):
- **Crates:** `tree-sitter` 0.27.0; grammar crates typescript 0.23.2, javascript 0.25.0, java 0.23.5, python 0.25.0 and go 0.25.0. Each exports `TAGS_QUERY`.
- **TypeScript:** `tags.scm` has only the TS additions (signatures, interfaces, abstract classes, modules). TS/TSX must run the JS query plus the TS query.
- **Java:** the stock tags have no enum, record or constructor definitions, so rb adds a small supplementary query.
- **Go:** method keys need the receiver type (`Circle#Area().`), otherwise two receivers' `Area` in one file collide. The receiver is read from the node in Rust.

- [x] 1. `rb-syntax` crate: the language registry (C14) and `extract(lang, bytes) -> FileFacts`, with tests first for C1–C4, C8, C13 and C17.
- [x] 2. Symbol keys + indexer assembly: Symbol / DEFINED_IN / CONTAINS (C2, C5, C6, C7); unit tests.
- [ ] 3. Facts cache: store load/save + CLI orchestration + parse counter (C9–C12).
- [ ] 4. Fixture goldens (C15, C16), real-repo measurement (C18), doc sync, evaluator pass, commit.
