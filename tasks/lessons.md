# Lessons

## 2026-09-29: numbers in reports come from the tool output, summed by a tool
- **Mistake:** I reported "188 unit tests" after a run that printed per-crate counts adding up to 153.
- **Rule:** Never state an aggregate I haven't computed from the tool output. Sum it with `awk`, or quote the per-crate lines as printed.

## 2026-09-29: "same algorithm" claims need an edge-case comparison, not a skim
- **Mistake:** I claimed TypeORM's `snakeCase` and Flask-SQLAlchemy's `camel_to_snake_case` were "the same two regex rules". They differ on names with underscores and leading capitals: `My_Table` gives `my_table` in TypeORM and `my__table` in Flask. I had also written that `snake_case` matched Hibernate, which it doesn't.
- **Rule:** Before calling two naming rules equivalent, run both over one table of edge cases: acronyms, digits, underscores, leading and trailing capitals, quoted names. Keep that table as a unit test.

## 2026-09-29: facts without imports can't identify a library by a bare name
- **Mistake:** I accepted a bare `Model` and any `*.models.Model` as Django, which caught Keras models.
- **Rule:** If a framework is detected by a short name, either use import facts or accept only the qualified form, and record the gap in the contract.

## 2026-09-30: a termination argument in a comment is a claim, so test it
- **Mistake:** I wrote "this terminates" above a round-based fixpoint whose per-name result could flip between rounds. Legal Java made it loop forever.
- **Rule:** Prefer structures that terminate by construction (memoised recursion with an on-path guard, visited sets) over fixpoints argued in comments. When a fixpoint is needed, add a test with a cycle and a test with a long chain.

## 2026-09-30: complexity claims need a timing test on a pathological input
- **Mistake:** I called the visited-set walks "linear". Each walk was linear, but it re-scanned the file for every base lookup and ran once per definition, which made the whole thing cubic. The same pass also showed that caching a result computed while a cycle was still open makes results depend on names.
- **Rule:** When a doc or comment claims a complexity, add a test that times a deep and a wide pathological input. Only cache results that don't depend on unfinished recursion.

## 2026-09-30: every recursion edge needs its cycle test, including indirect ones
- **Mistake:** I guarded the member and supertype walks, but not type resolution → qualifier → binding → type resolution. Real Python (`session = session.Session()`) overflowed the stack on psf/requests.
- **Rule:** List every call edge of a recursive component (A→B→C→A), not just the obvious self-recursion. Guard the component at one entry point, and give each edge a cycle test with a self-referential input.

## 2026-09-30: never hand-count positions in test expectations
- **Mistake:** the visibility-extent test had four expectations with columns I counted by eye. Each was off by one to three, and it took six test runs to converge, each time "fixing" the expectation to the output.
- **Rule:** Derive expected positions from the source in the test itself (`src.find("token")` plus a length), or assert relations ("`c`'s extent ends before `c.Next()`") rather than raw numbers. When a numeric expectation fails, check the semantics first; only then copy the number.

## 2026-09-30: never attribute a metric change without diffing the edge sets
- **Mistake:** hono's resolved share fell from 14.8% to 13.5% after a fix, and I wrote in the changelog that middleware `next()` calls were the cause. The evaluator diffed the edge sets: all 329 lost edges were calls to `const f = () => …` functions that my fix had wrongly suppressed. I had described a regression as an improvement.
- **Rule:** When a measurement moves, diff the before/after edge sets (or sites) and classify the difference before writing a sentence about why. A change without a classified diff is reported as "changed, cause not yet classified".
